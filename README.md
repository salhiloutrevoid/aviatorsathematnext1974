## What is the Aviator Game?

Aviator is a crash game developed by Spribe, known for its innovative

multiplier that increases as the plane ascends. The longer the player
waits before cashing out, the higher the potential winnings, but there's
also a risk involved, as the plane may crash at any moment, resulting in
the loss of the bet.
